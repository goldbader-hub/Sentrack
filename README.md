SenTrack is a Python-based tool for live-cell assessment of cellular senescence using lysosomal profiling. It performs single-cell image analysis from DAPI and LysoTracker images, with optional SA-β-Gal–based training, validation, and quality control workflows.

## Quick start

SenTrack is a Python-based tool for live-cell lysosomal senescence analysis using fluorescence imaging.

### Requirements
- Python 3.9 or newer
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- A standard fluorescence imaging dataset (DAPI + LysoTracker; SA-β-Gal optional)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SenTrack.git
cd SenTrack
pip install -r requirements.txt
